Three methods are added to the XML class (src/main/java/org/json).
They are:
    - parseByPath(XMLTokener, JSONObject, String[], int)
    - toJSONObject(Reader, JSONPointer)
    - toJSONObject(Reader, JSONPointer, JSONObject)

A new class XMLM2Test (src/test/java/org/json/junit/data) is added 
with JUnit test cases.
